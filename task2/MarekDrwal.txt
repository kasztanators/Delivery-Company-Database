1. Find the number of students in each group, ordered by the number of students in each group:

SELECT Groups_in_a_semester.ID, COUNT(belongs_to.student_id) as "Number of Students"
FROM Groups_in_a_semester
LEFT JOIN belongs_to ON Groups_in_a_semester.ID = belongs_to.group_id
GROUP BY Groups_in_a_semester.ID
ORDER BY COUNT(belongs_to.student_id) DESC
2. Find the number of applications received in a specific year and semester, grouped by the type of benefit applied for:
SELECT COUNT(Applications.ID) as "Number of Applications", Kinds_of_benefits.kind
FROM Applications
INNER JOIN Amounts_of_benefits ON Applications.rank_group = Amounts_of_benefits.ID
INNER JOIN Kinds_of_benefits ON Amounts_of_benefits.kind = Kinds_of_benefits.ID
WHERE Amounts_of_benefits.year = [year] AND Amounts_of_benefits.semester = [semester]
GROUP BY Kinds_of_benefits.kind

Find the students with the highest average grade, limited to the top 10 students:
SELECT Students.*, AVG(Applications.avg_grade) as "Average Grade"
FROM Students
INNER JOIN Applications ON Students.album_nb = Applications.sender
GROUP BY Students.album_nb
ORDER BY AVG(Applications.avg_grade) DESC
LIMIT 10

Find the average value of all approved benefits, grouped by the type of benefit:

SELECT AVG(Decisions.value) as "Average Value", Kinds_of_benefits.kind
FROM Decisions
INNER JOIN Applications ON Decisions.application = Applications.ID
INNER JOIN Kinds_of_benefits ON Applications.benefit_kind = Kinds_of_benefits.ID
WHERE Decisions.approved = 1
GROUP BY Kinds_of_benefits.kind
